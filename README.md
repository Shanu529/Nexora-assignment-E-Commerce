merce Assignment

⚡ Important Note:
This project was built as a fast-track assignment to demonstrate basic full-stack functionality.
It’s a simple prototype — not focused on advanced security, validations, or optimized structure.
Image uploads are functional but not via URL — designed for demonstration purposes only.
